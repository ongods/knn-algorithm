### KNN-Algorithm Practice Projects

This repository contains practice Python files for learning basic machine learning concepts using **scikit-learn**. The focus is on classification tasks with the **Iris** and **Breast Cancer** datasets.

---

### Files

### 1. `iris_practice.py`
- Uses the **Iris dataset** from scikit-learn.
- Implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier.
- Steps included:
  - Loading the Iris dataset
  - Splitting data into training and test sets
  - Training the KNN model
  - Making predictions on test data
  - Evaluating accuracy
  - Visualizing results with a confusion matrix

### 2. `breast_cancer_practice.py`
- Uses the **Breast Cancer dataset** from scikit-learn.
- Implements a classifier (e.g., KNN or other models you tried).
- Steps included:
  - Loading the Breast Cancer dataset
  - Splitting data into training and test sets
  - Scaling the data
  - Training the model
  - Making predictions on test data
  - Evaluating accuracy
  - Visualizing results with a confusion matrix
  - Visualizing results with an accuracy vs k-value graph

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for plotting confusion matrix)
